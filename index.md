M²aia (MSI applications for interactive analysis in MITK, [biotools:m2aia](https://bio.tools/m2aia), [RRID:SCR_019324](https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_019324)) is a software tool enabling interactive signal processing and visualisation of [mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry_imaging) datasets. M²aia extends the open source [Medical Imaging and Interaction Toolkit (MITK)](https://www.mitk.org) [1,2] and provides powerful methods that the MSI community can adopt, exploit and improve further. In it's current state, it is designed to enable multi-modal 2D registration and 3D MSI reconstruction.

In addition, M²aia provides features for 

* Read/write access to the open standard imzML
* Image interaction and visualization
* Signal processing: Normalization, baseline correction, smoothing and peak picking
* Image segmentation
* Multi-modal 3D reconstruction of MSI images 
* Image registration of 2D multi-modal images
